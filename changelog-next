- Added support for first-run setup when no configuration is present.
  - If modpack is not defined, it will ask you to provide url, id or name.
  - If url is provided, it will automatically extract modpack id and optionally the version (if not set, it will ask for it).
  - If id is provided, it will use it to lookup the pack, then require selecting version.
  - Otherwise it will search for the modpack by name, allowing you to select it. After that you need to select the version.
- Improved handling of hashes and old file cleaning. It should now do better job and preserve modified, but not updated files.
- Added support for non SHA-512 hashes. SHA-512 is still used for modpack file validation.
